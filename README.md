### Quadratic Trigonometric Function Approximation – RTL & CModel

This project is part of a hardware-oriented technical assessment involving functional modeling, RTL design, simulation, and precision optimization of a quadratic approximation circuit for a trigonometric function.

### Project overview:
Implementing a hardware-friendly approximation of the function:
f(x) = sin(2x - π/4),  where x ∈ [0, 2)

### The solution involves several design layers:
MATLAB/Octave Modeling – generate approximation coefficients - done
C++ CModel – validate precision using Algorithmic-C data types - done
SystemVerilog RTL – hardware implementation - Partially completed — there were some issues with the project configuration, and the      time allocated for submission has expired.
Verilator + GTKWave – simulation & waveform analysis
Design Optimization – minimize coefficient bitwidth under error constraint

Attachements:
Photography of calculations.
